Org Mode / NOWEB
================

This folder contains the reworking of the GNU Prolog Redis client that
I released sometime previously. It is for practice using Emacs' Org
mode instead of using Emacs and noweb mode, which for mer never felt
like it worke that well especially when setting up multi-mode and all
that other seemingly complicated stuff sometimes felt like it was in
the way.

So, nothing really to see here other than maybe an example of using
Org mode to produce a working Prolog source file and PDF
documentation.

Thanks.
